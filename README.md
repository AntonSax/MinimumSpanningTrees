# MinimumSpanningTrees
Algorithms that traverse graphs in order to find the minimum spanning trees of the graph.

These files run Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm for determining minimum spanning trees.
NOTE: Both files starting with MST are .cpp files that run based off of the GraphDataStructure files, but they are separate main functions.
